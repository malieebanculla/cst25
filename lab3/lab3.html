    <h1>Lab 3</h1>
    <h2>Describe the task or game you picked to me so I can understand it</h2>
    <p>The task we decided to go with is a mirror simulator, where participants can place cubes on either side of a bar(mirror), and it reflects the cubes an equal distance on the other side.</p>
    <h2>Write down brief answers to the questions we asked:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
        What actions can I take?
        </li>
        <li>
        What do I need to remember or keep track of?
        </li>
        <li>
        What do I do over and over again?
        </li>
        <li>
        When do I need to make decisions?
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Write down a pseudocode process for your task</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Check position of mirror on the y-axis</li>
        <li>Set cubes on screen, and check position of the cube that is placed</li>
        <li>Keep track of the x-axis of the cube(it’s the same in the reflection)</li>
        <li>Check distance between the cube and the mirror</li>
        <li>If on top, subtract double the distance of the cube’s y-axis from the y-axis of the mirror. Add double if placed below</li>
        <li>Add that value to the y-axis of the reflection (which should already have the x-axis from step 3)</li>
    </ol>
